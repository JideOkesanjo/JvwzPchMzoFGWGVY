The goal of this project is to establish a robust intelligent system to aid in value investing efforts using stock market data. The system will help make investment decisions and based on intrinsic value of companies. It will not, however, trade on the basis of daily market volatility. At the end of the project we will be able to:

Predict stock price valuations on a daily, weekly and monthly basis
Recommend to buy, sell or hold based on certain decision parameters
Maximize capital returns, minimise loses, and minise hold periods
